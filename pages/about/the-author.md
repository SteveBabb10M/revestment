Steve Babb is Manx. He lives on the Isle of Man, where his family has been for generations. He and his wife teach on the island; their children were born and educated there.

For several years he served as the official photographer for Tynwald, documenting the ceremonies and proceedings of the world's oldest continuous parliament. The photographs in this site's gallery come from that work.

*Revestment* grew from a simple question: why isn't this history taught? The constitutional relationship between Mann and Britain — Crown Dependency, external definition, the absence of representation — dates from 1765. The economic and demographic consequences shaped the island for a century. Yet the story remains largely unknown, even on the island itself.

This book is an attempt to tell that story properly: with documentary evidence, with scholarly rigour, and with the emotional honesty that the subject deserves. It is written for trade readers — people who might encounter it at the Lexicon bookshop or the Manx Museum — not for academic specialists. The endnotes carry the scholarly apparatus; the prose tells the human story.

The companion project, *Dominion*, provides the constitutional analysis. But *Revestment* comes first, because the story comes first. Before the structures, before the diagnosis, there were people — and those people deserve to have what happened to them understood.
