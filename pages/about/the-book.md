## What This Book Is

*Revestment: The Crime of Crown Dependence* tells the story of what happened to the Isle of Man when the British Parliament decided to buy it.

In 1765, Parliament passed the Act of Revestment, purchasing the island from the Duke of Atholl for £70,000. The stated purpose was to suppress smuggling — the "running trade" that had made Mann a waypoint for goods flowing untaxed into Britain. The actual consequence was the destruction of an economy, the collapse of infrastructure, and a century of emigration that scattered Manx families across the Atlantic world.

This is a Manx book, written from the Manx perspective, for readers who have never heard this story — because until now, it hasn't been told.

## The Three Parts

**Part I: Before** — The world that existed before Parliament intervened. The ancient parliament at Tynwald. The Deemsters and their herring-bone oath. The Lords of Mann — Stanleys and Atholls — who governed for three centuries. Bishop Wilson's fifty-seven-year episcopate. The fishing economy, the smuggling trade, the families who made their living from the sea.

**Part II: The Seizure** — How Parliament took the island. The constitutional mechanism. The garrison deployment. The Act itself — and what it didn't say. The voices that were silenced, the petition that was ignored, the Keys stripped of their power to resist.

**Part III: After** — What happened next. The revenue that collapsed to £530. The harbours that rotted. The families who left — one-third of the population within a generation. The language that began its decline. The petitions to Parliament that were met with silence. And, eventually, the survival. *Quocunque Jeceris Stabit* — whichever way you throw me, I will stand.

## The Evidence

This is not a polemic. It is a work of documentary history, built on primary sources: the Atholl Papers, the Treasury Papers, the Home Office Papers, the 1792 Commissioners' Report, the parliamentary debates of 1765, 1790, and 1805.

Parliament knew what it had done. The evidence is in Parliament's own records — confessions extracted across forty years of debate, investigations that documented the devastation, admissions that the purchase had been "compulsive," a "scandalous job," a constitutional wrong that was never put right.

The book presents that evidence. The endnotes document every claim. The companion website makes the primary sources available for anyone who wants to see them.

## Why This Book

This history is not taught in Manx schools. Most people on the island have never heard of the Revestment, or know only that "something happened in 1765." The constitutional settlement that shapes Mann's relationship with Britain today — Crown Dependency, neither colony nor country — emerged from this moment, and from Parliament's failure to remedy what it had done.

The Manx people deserve to have their history documented with the same rigour applied to larger nations. "Too small to matter" is a judgment made by those who should have been protecting the island. It is not a fact.
