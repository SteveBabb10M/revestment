This history isn't currently taught in Manx schools. These materials are designed to help change that — resources that teachers can use in the classroom and parents can use at home.

All materials are free to download and use for educational purposes.

## Key Stage 2 (Ages 7–11)

Activities for upper primary, suitable for themed projects and cross-curricular work. The focus is on the world that existed — ships, trade, Tynwald, daily life — rather than the constitutional complexity of what Parliament did.

<h4>The Smuggling Ship Challenge</h4>

<h4>Tynwald Hill</h4>
<p>Colouring sheets and labelling activities. The four tiers, the ceremony, the flags. The parliament that still meets every July.</p>

## Key Stage 3 (Ages 11–14)

Materials for secondary history classes. These resources engage with the real history — the constitutional questions, the primary sources, the human cost. Students can handle the complexity; these materials help them access it.

<div class="card card-teaching">
<span class="ks-badge ks3">KS3</span>
<h4>The Running Trade</h4>
<p>Why did smuggling happen? The economics, the risks, the people involved. Primary source extracts and discussion questions.</p>

<h4>The Revestment: What Parliament Did</h4>
<p>The Act of 1765. The garrison. The consequences. Document study with guided questions.</p>

<h4>Voices from the Island</h4>

<h4>The Aftermath</h4>
<p>Population decline. Emigration. Language death. Working with historical data — census figures, revenue tables, the numbers that tell the story.</p>

<h4>Source Evaluation</h4>
<p>Comparing primary and secondary sources. Governor Wood says troops came "not to oppress." The Keys say people are "reduced to Despair." Who do you believe? Why?</p>

## For Teachers

These materials are designed to be flexible. Use them as standalone activities, as part of a larger unit on local history, or as cross-curricular resources linking history with literacy, geography, art, and design technology.

All PDFs can be shared via Google Classroom, Teams, or printed for classroom use.

If you use these materials in your school, we'd love to hear about it. Feedback helps us improve the resources and understand what teachers need.

## For Parents

Rainy half-term? Looking for something educational that isn't a screen? These activities work at home too. Build a smuggling ship in the garden. Colour Tynwald Hill at the kitchen table. Learn something about where you live — history that most of us never learned ourselves.
