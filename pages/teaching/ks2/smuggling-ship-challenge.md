## The Challenge

The year is 1760. You are a Manx ship designer. Your job is to create a vessel that can:

- Sail fast enough to outrun the customs cutters
- Carry valuable cargo without it being discovered
- Navigate the shallow waters around the Manx coast
- Survive the rough seas of the Irish Sea

## Background: The Running Trade

Before 1765, the Isle of Man was a busy trading hub. Ships sailed between Mann and ports in England, Ireland, and Scotland, carrying goods like:

- **Tea** — expensive and heavily taxed in Britain
- **Brandy** — French brandy was popular but carried high duties
- **Tobacco** — from the American colonies
- **Silk and lace** — luxury goods for wealthy customers

These goods were legal to buy and sell on Mann. But if they were taken to Britain without paying customs duties, that was smuggling — the "running trade."

The Manx luggers were perfectly designed for this work. Fast, nimble, and crewed by sailors who knew every cove and beach around the island.

## Activity 1: Design Your Ship

**You will need:** Paper, pencils, rulers

**Your task:** Design a smuggling lugger. Think about:

1. **Hull shape** — How will it move fast through the water?
2. **Sails** — What rig will give you speed and control?
3. **Hidden compartments** — Where will you hide the cargo?
4. **Shallow draft** — Can it sail close to shore to escape?

Draw your design with labels explaining your choices.

## Activity 2: The Egg Boat Challenge

**You will need:** 
- Recycled materials (plastic bottles, cardboard, foam, etc.)
- Tape, string, elastic bands
- A raw egg (your "cargo")
- A grassy slope or field (your "sea")

**Your task:** Build a small craft that can:

1. Carry an egg safely down a slope without breaking it
2. Travel as far as possible
3. Use elastic band power or gravity — no batteries!

**The test:** Release your craft at the top of the slope. Did the egg survive the voyage? How far did it travel?

**Extension:** What design changes would help it go further? What would protect the cargo better?

## Discussion Questions

1. Why did people on Mann get involved in smuggling?
2. Was it fair that goods were taxed so heavily in Britain?
3. What risks did the smugglers take?
4. What happened to the Manx economy when Parliament stopped the trade?
