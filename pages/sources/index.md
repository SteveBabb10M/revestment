The strength of *Revestment* is its evidence base. Every claim in the book is documented; every quotation is sourced. This section makes those sources accessible — the original documents, transcriptions, and the scholarly bibliography.

Many of these materials are available thanks to the extraordinary work of Frances Coakley and the [Manx Notebook](https://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/), which has digitised and transcribed vast quantities of Manx historical documents. Where we link to Manx Notebook transcriptions, we do so with gratitude and attribution.
