## Tynwald Day

The annual ceremony at St John's — the procession from the chapel, the officials on the tiered hill, the laws proclaimed in Manx and English. These photographs were taken during the author's years as official photographer for Tynwald.

**The ceremony:** Tynwald Day is held on 5th July each year (or the following Monday if 5th July falls on a weekend). The ceremony at St John's is open to the public. If you've never been, go. Stand with the crowd and watch the parliament assemble on the hill. It's been happening for a thousand years, and it's still happening now.
