## Further Reading

The following works are recommended for readers who want to go deeper into Manx history:

**A.W. Moore** — *A History of the Isle of Man* (1900). The foundational modern history, comprehensive and still valuable despite its age.

**Joseph Train** — *An Historical and Statistical Account of the Isle of Man* (1845). Victorian in perspective but invaluable for its documentary coverage and access to sources that were closer to the events.

**R.H. Kinvig** — *The Isle of Man: A Social, Cultural and Political History* (1975). The standard academic history of the twentieth century.

**Frances Coakley (ed.)** — Various transcriptions on Manx Notebook. Not a single work but an indispensable collection of primary sources made accessible.
