  <h2>A History That Should Have Been Told</h2>
  <p class="intro-text">
    In 1765, the British Parliament purchased the Isle of Man from the Duke of Atholl. 
    They called it "revestment" — the return of sovereignty to the Crown. 
    But for the Manx people, it was something else entirely: the destruction of their economy, 
    the beginning of a century of emigration, and the start of a constitutional relationship 
    that would strip them of self-governance for generations.
  </p>
  <p class="intro-text">
    This is the story that isn't taught in Manx schools. This website accompanies the book 
    with primary sources, scholarly endnotes, and teaching materials for those who want 
    to learn — and teach — what really happened.
